The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

              $(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2$ = $55^2$ = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of the sum.
